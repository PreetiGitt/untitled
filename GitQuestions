Git Squash: merging multiple incremental commits into one
Git Merge : merge changes

Git CheryPick: pick a specific commit from one branch to another, make sure you are on branch that wants to pick the commit. git cherrypick <commithash>

fetch vs pull


Git Rebase
: rebasing is that you get a much cleaner project history. First, it eliminates the unnecessary merge commits required by git merge. 
Second, as you can see in the above diagram, rebasing also results in a perfectly linear project history
-  rebasing loses the context provided by a merge commit—you can’t see when upstream changes were incorporated into the feature.
Git interactive Rebase :
 this is used to clean up a messy history before merging a feature branch into main.

Git branch strategies : feature, release, master
