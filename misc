1. Immutable class and use case : for DTOs to transfer data unchanged, as a key in hashmap, config settings which need to be unchanged
2. @Conditional : can override autoconfig in springboot, allows you to register beans conditionally
    @ConditionalOnProperty: Checks for the presence and value of specific properties in the Spring environment.
3. Composition over Inheritance : has-A gives more flexibilty and Avoid Fragile Base Class Problem: Changes in a superclass can break subclasses.
4. Spring secuity:
5. Spring bean lifecycle : initilaisation, depency injection, custonm init()-> ready
6. Spring scaling: using spring cloud, load balancer
7. How to save sensitive data: encryption, vault services
8. Testing approach: unit-> slice-> integration
9. Logging : log4j
   Grafana (Open source, for smalller apps) vs splunk (enterprise level, can query the data)
8. @FeignClient: for inetr-service communication.
       When a microservice wants to call another serviceâ€™s API, developers often use HTTP clients or
REST templates to make those calls.
Although these are functional methods, they entail a lot of boilerplate code, making the codebase harder to maintain and understand.
 The WebClient is Asynchronous and non blocking REST invoker.
While the Feign client and RestTemplates creates a thread for each request and blocks it until it receives a response.

9. Fallback if an API doesnt get repsonse
  @FeignClient(name = "other-service", fallback = OtherServiceFallback.class)
public interface OtherServiceClient {     
    @GetMapping("/api/data")
    String getData();
}
  @Component
public class OtherServiceFallback implements OtherServiceClient {
    @Override
    public String getData() {
        return "Fallback: service unavailable";
    }
}

11. Spring Config sever : to export common configurations centrally 
   put the file as "appName.yml" and provide git link of file in config server
