** RabbitMq
    The consumer application takes a passive role and waits for the RabbitMQ broker to PUSH the message into the queue.
A RabbitMQ broker allows for low latency and complex message distributions with the following components:
1.An exchange-- receives messages from the producer and determines where they should be routed to
2.A queue -- is storage that receives messages from an exchange and sends them to consumers
3.A binding --is a path that connects an exchange and a broker
In RabbitMQ, a routing key is a message attribute that is used to route messages from an exchange to a specific queue.
When a producer sends a message to an exchange, it includes a routing key as part of the message. 
The exchange then uses this routing key to determine which queue the message should be delivered to.

A RabbitMQ broker routes the message to the destination queue. 
Once read, the consumer sends an acknowledgement (ACK) reply to the broker, which then deletes the message from the queue.
