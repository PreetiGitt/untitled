-----How Microservices communicate 
     1. RestTemplate
     2. WebClient (non-blocking)
     3. FeignClient (Single therad making an api call & exceuteing the API )


-----------
**Architecture Pattern
  1. Event Driven
  2. Saga : It is an asynchronous and eventually consistent transactional approach, which is quite analogous to a typical microservices application architecture,
where a distributed transaction is fulfilled by a set of asynchronous transactions on related microservices
  3. Aggregator : Aggregator Design Pattern is a service that receives a request, then makes requests of multiple services,
combines the results and responds to the initiating request.


  4. Circuit breaker : hystrix
  4. Proxy design pattern : So, the main idea behind this pattern is, not to expose each microservice to their consumers and
instead it should go through an interface.

**Kafka (Producer Kafka template KafkaTemplate<String, String>, 
            Cosnumer -@KafkaListener(topics = "NewTopic", 
                   groupId = "group_id") 
   -- Apache Kafka is a  open source distributed streaming platform that allows for publishing, 
       subscribing to, storing, and processing streams of records in real-time
    -- pub sub model, high throughput , more efficinet, scalable
    --Kafka consumers, however, are more proactive in reading and tracking informatio

** RabbitMq:
       @EnableRabbit in SpringBoot main class
    The consumer application takes a passive role and waits for the RabbitMQ broker to PUSH the message into the queue.
A RabbitMQ broker allows for low latency and complex message distributions with the following components:
1.An exchange-- receives messages from the producer and determines where they should be routed to
2.A queue -- is storage that receives messages from an exchange and sends them to consumers
3.A binding --is a path that connects an exchange and a broker
In RabbitMQ, a routing key is a message attribute that is used to route messages from an exchange to a specific queue.
When a producer sends a message to an exchange, it includes a routing key as part of the message. 
The exchange then uses this routing key to determine which queue the message should be delivered to.

A RabbitMQ broker routes the message to the destination queue. 
Once read, the consumer sends an acknowledgement (ACK) reply to the broker, which then deletes the message from the queue.


Microservices:Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined API
        scalable, resilient, agile, resusable code, ease in deployment.
**SpringConfig: is implemented in client-server model.

      1. For Server :create SpringConfig server with maven dependency : @EnableConfigServer
               spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=ssh://localhost/config-repo
              spring.cloud.config.server.git.clone-on-start=true
      2. For Client: 
            spring.application.name=config-client
            spring.profiles.active=development
            spring.config.import=optional:configserver:serverURL

**SpringDiscovery: eureka

**SpringAPIGateway: Spring Cloud, give predicates
