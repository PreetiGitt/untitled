o	Red-Black Tree:
     Binary Tree with self-balancing rules so that distance b/w root and leaf node is never more than twice of shortest path.
Reduces complexity in insertion and deletion
âœ… Properties of Red-Black Tree
1.	Every node is either red or black
2.	Root is always black
3.	Red nodes cannot have red children (no two red nodes in a row)
4.	Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes must have the same number of black nodes (called black-height)
5.	New insertions are red by default
--------------------------------------
o	Java TreeMap Implementation:
  Utilizes Red-Black tree for self balancing
   Keys are always sorted either in natural or custom order.
o	Java Tree-Set:
Also uses RB tree with uniue elements.
