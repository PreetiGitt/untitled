Deployments:
  Zero downtime:
 1. B/G : older version on blue , new version tested on green
 2. Canary: Deploy new version (Canary) to a small % of traffic, e.g., 5%.
 3. Rolling : Updates instances one batch at a time. No full downtime, but some nodes are on the old version during deployment.

lambda:
  cold start: This delay happens because AWS needs to set up the execution environment before your function code runs.
