SELECT GETDATE();

Inner Join= Common

Cross = total-> common+left+right

 eg: SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;        
 This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country,      it orders them by CustomerName
