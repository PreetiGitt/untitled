                        3.Builder Pattern- building a complex object with as many as fields we want to be included or excluded
                           Approach: build a static inner class which will set param to User class constuctor as per demand
                  
                                                 public class User {                  ||||||||  in main
                                              int a;                                  ||||||||   User obj= new User.Builder().setA(10).setB(20).build();
                                                                                                        System.out.println(obj.getA()+":"+obj.getB());

****Structural:
   1. Adapter Design Pattern





*****Behavioural
  1. Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects 
    so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

  2. Strategy Design Pattern : The Strategy Design Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable,
  allowing clients to switch algorithms dynamically without altering the code structure.
    eg: Set Interface -> can use HashSet or TreeSet

  3. Memento Design pattern: to save and restore the previous state

  4. Chain of Responsibility: implements loose-coulping and single responsibilty, define how a request pass thru a chain of objects
    refer : https://medium.com/@ngneha090/beginners-guide-to-chain-responsibility-design-pattern-in-java-e1e0ddac2cb6
     
  5. State Change: different behaviour as per state
